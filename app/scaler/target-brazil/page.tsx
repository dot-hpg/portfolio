  { title: "Recalibrate delivery estimates per state", desc: "Estimates are padded by 11 days on average and up to 20 days in the North. Show realistic dates at checkout, and add buffer in AL and MA (20-24% late)." },
  { title: "Localise supply", desc: "Same-state items arrive 2x faster with 43% lower freight. Recruit sellers in BA, PE and RJ, which have 70-180 customers per seller, and pilot a North-East cross-dock." },
  { title: "Make freight affordable in remote states", desc: "Freight is 22-29% of the item price in the North and North-East, against 14% in SP. Use bulk carrier contracts, subsidised shipping and free-shipping thresholds." },
  { title: "Plan peak capacity early", desc: "Black Friday 2017 brought 5x a normal day's orders, and late deliveries jumped to 12.4% that month. Pre-book carriers and staff from October, and widen estimates during peaks." },
  { title: "Grow basket size", desc: "Average order value has been flat at about R$160 for two years. Promote 10x interest-free plans, which already carry R$415 tickets, on high-ticket categories, and add bundles." },
  { title: "Build retention", desc: "97% of customers buy once. Loyalty programmes, post-delivery coupons and personalised recommendations are the cheapest growth available now that acquisition has plateaued." },
  { title: "Time marketing to the afternoon and evening", desc: "38% of orders arrive 13:00-18:00 and 28% at night. Focus flash sales and paid media on 13:00-22:00, and run maintenance at dawn." },
